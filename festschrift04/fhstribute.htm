<P>Frank Stillinger is one of the major figures of contemporary theoretical
chemistry. In the course of a career spanning 45 years, he has produced a body
of work whose quality, depth, breadth, and importance admit few parallels in
this field. The major themes of Frank's research have been the molecular theory
of water and aqueous solutions, structure and relaxation processes in
supercooled liquids and glasses, the physical chemistry of liquid and solid
interfaces, the theory of phase transitions, the statistical geometry of hard
particle packings, and molecular quantum theory. </P>

<P>Underlying his vast scientific output is a mastery of theoretical techniques
and a truly visionary appreciation for the power of molecular-based computer
simulation, which Frank has used, with admirable consistency, to extract deep
physical insight from every problem he has tackled. What follows is a brief
synopsis of some of the highlights of Frank's scientific output, grouped by
topic. </P>
<H4>Water and Aqueous Solutions</H4>
<P>Frank's pioneering molecular dynamics studies of water, with Aneesur Rahman
[54, 65, 66, 72, 100]<SUP><IMG src=fhstribute_files/Dagger.gif></SUP> had an
extraordinary impact (1045 citations to date for [66], 692 for [54]), because
they showed, for the first time, how water's liquid-phase anomalies could be
obtained from relatively simple potentials. Almost thirty years after its
publication, the Rahman and Stillinger paper on sound propagation in liquid
water [68] remains one of the classic examples of the discovery of a new
phenomenon by computer simulation. In this case, the phenomenon was "fast
sound", the search for a full understanding of which constitutes an active area
of research. Frank's 1973 paper on the structure<A
href=#jp040532st00001><IMG
src="fhstribute_files/smsun.gif"></A> and statistical mechanics of aqueous
solutionsof nonpolar solutes ([63], with 250 citations) laid the foundation of
modern theories of hydrophobic hydration. </P>
<H4>Glasses and Supercooled Liquids</H4>
<P>The glass transition is one of the most active areas of research in condensed
matter theory. Frank has been one of the major intellectual driving forces in
this field. Building on prescient arguments by Martin Goldstein (<I>J. Chem.
Phys</I>. <B>1969</B>, <I>51</I>, 3728), Frank formulated the "inherent
structure" or "energy landscape" theory of liquids and glasses [122] (with Tom
Weber; 511 citations). This statistical mechanical formalism, in which
equilibrium configurations are mapped onto local potential energy minima, is one
of the most widely used tools in the analysis of glass formation phenomena.
Frank's powerful theoretical superstructure underlies a major body of work by
leading international researchers on topics as diverse as landscape-based
approaches to protein folding, investigations of cluster stability, and
computational studies of the glass transition. He has used the inherent
structure formalism to obtain deep and important theoretical results, such as
the impossibility of an ideal glass transition in molecular liquids [170] (147
citations) and the exponential multiplicity of local minima in energy landscapes
[240]. His many computational applications of the inherent structure formalism
include the demonstration, with Srikanth Sastry and one of us, of the
relationship between dynamics and the manner in which a system samples its
energy landscape [234] (263 citations), and the application of energy
minimization to relaxation dynamics in liquids [135] (307 citations), melting
and freezing phenomena [110, 152], and the calculation of mechanical properties
of glasses [255, 266]. </P>
<H4>Particle Packings</H4>
<P>Frank's many contributions in the area of particle packings include the
formulation with Edmund DiMarzio of a fundamental theory of the hard-disk phase
transition [19]; the development of the widely used Lubachevsky-Stillinger
algorithm for the simulation of hard-particle packings [186]; the
identification, with Tom Truskett and ourselves, of a structural precursor to
freezing in hard-sphere and hard-disk systems [236]; the development, with one
of us, of systematic procedures for the generation and classification of jammed
hard-particle packings [260], for controlling short-range order in particle
packings [265], and for the efficient generation of dense polydisperse packings
[267]; and the demonstration with Aleksandar Donev and one of us that disordered
hard ellipsoid systems pack as densely as the densest crystal hard sphere
packings [278]. </P>
<H4>Fluid Interfaces and Clusters</H4>
<P>Frank's 1965 paper on the vapor/liquid interface in the critical region with
Frank Buff and Ronald Lovett [25] (428 citations) introduced the capillary wave
theory of fluid interfaces. His 1963 paper on physical clusters [13] (133
citations) has been highly influential in the framing rigorous statistical
mechanical approaches to nucleation phenomena. </P>
<H4>Electrolytes</H4>
<P>In 1968, Frank and Ronald Lovett wrote three important papers on the
statistical mechanics of concentrated electrolytes [37, 38, 42]. This work
contains a fundamental new and exact result, the so-called "Stillinger-Lovett
second moment condition" on the radial distribution of ion densities [42] (237
citations). </P>
<H4>Miscellaneous</H4>
<P>Space limitations make it impossible to do full justice to Frank Stillinger's
output. Although the above comments mention some of the highlights, numerous
other contributions deserve mention. These include a classic 1986 paper with Tom
Weber [150], which introduced the widely used Stillinger-Weber potential for the
computer simulation of silicon; this is his most cited work, with 1373 "hits" to
date. Additional notable accomplishments include Frank's insightful analysis of
the rotation-translation paradox of nucleation theory [36]; his theoretical and
computational studies, many in collaboration with his wife, Dorothea Stillinger,
of Gaussian core fluids [22, 41, 85, 101, 102, 110, 115, 116, 120, 133, 228];
his numerous contributions to theoretical and computational quantum chemistry
[3, 30, 47, 71, 78, 90, 104, 143, 171, 190, 250]; the development of the tiling
model of the glass transition with Tom Weber, Glenn Fredrickson, and Jonathan
Harris [160, 162, 166, 179, 180]; a plausible interpretation of the breakdown of
the Stokes-Einstein relation in supercooled liquids [206]; and the introduction,
with Tom Truskett, Chris Roberts, and one of us, of the notion of the equation
of state of an energy landscape [243]. With Melissa Feeney and one of us, Frank
recently introduced the first statistical mechanical model of inverse melting
[271]. This refers to the unusual but experimentally observed phenomenon whereby
a liquid freezes upon being heated, with implications in materials science and
possibly biology [272]. </P>
<H4>Reviews</H4>
<P>Last, but by no means least, we want to mention several important reviews
that Frank has written. The clarity and elegance of his writing, together with
his encyclopedic knowledge of the subject matter, make these much-cited articles
as valuable to the specialist as they are to those venturing into these topics
for the first time. Examples include his articles on water [105] (475
citations), and on supercooled liquids and the glass transition ([217], with 395
citations; [254], with 209 citations). </P>
<P>The bulk of Frank Stillinger's distinguished career was spent at Bell
Laboratories, where he was a member of the technical staff from 1959 until 2000.
He headed Bell Laboratory's Chemical Physics Research Department between 1976
and 1978, and was a member of Agere Systems' technical staff between 2000 and
2001. For the past eight years, Frank has been associated with Princeton
University, through Visiting Research Collaborator appointments with the
Princeton Materials Institute and the Chemistry Department, where he is now a
Senior Scientist. During this period, both of us have been privileged to
collaborate with him on a wide variety of scientific topics. Several of our
respective graduate students have benefited greatly from Frank's involvement in
their research projects. </P>
<P>The distinguishing characteristics of Frank Stillinger's work are technical
mastery, clarity of thought, and elegance of expression in the service of
physical insight and fundamental understanding. Recognition of Frank's numerous
accomplishments includes election to the National Academy of Sciences (1984) and
receipt of the ACS Hildebrand (1986) and Debye (1992) awards, the APS Langmuir
Prize (1989), and the Onsager Medal (2002). This volume, for which we are
privileged to serve as guest editors, honors Frank Stillinger's outstanding
scientific output on the happy occasion of his 70th birthday.

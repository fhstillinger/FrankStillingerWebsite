<P>The factors that capture attention and create long-term interests in young 
children have been, and will remain, subjects of speculation and debate. This is 
certainly the case for those children who, as adults, eventually choose for 
their careers the highly focused professions of mathematics, engineering, and 
science. As a child of the Great Depression (born August 15, 1934) and of the 
Second World War, I have found it easy to believe that social stresses and 
values prevalent during those years must have exerted strong formative 
influences. In particular, the physical sciences at that time enjoyed a romantic 
aura that was propagated by newspapers and serious magazines, but that also was 
enhanced by the popular science fiction of that period that was offered in pulp 
magazines and low-budget movies. The notion that science could be the source of 
various dangers, such as nuclear threat and environmental insults, had not yet 
appeared. However, while this broad background without a doubt had a significant 
effect, in my own case, many specific memories seem to reveal that several other 
formative influences were also at play. </P>
<P>My earliest childhood was spent in the small New Jersey towns of Ewingville, 
Pennington, and Boonton. Vivid visual memories from that time-of huge 
lighter-than-air craft drifting slowly across the sky, likely on their way to, 
or from, Lakehurst, NJ-still remain. Those images seemed to have stirred a 
curiosity that later sought answers about how such floating behemoths could 
possibly work. Of course, this era soon terminated following the infamous 
Hindenberg tragedy on May 6, 1937. </P>
<P>That was also a time during which my parents, despite limited income, managed 
to expose their first child to a set of books revealing the wonders of the solar 
system astronomy and the age of dinosaurs. These engaging subjects quickly 
became the source of intense, almost mystical, flights of imagination. Certainly 
I was not the only child smitten by these topics at the time. A reasonable guess 
is that a large fraction of those from that era who, as I have, ended up in 
adulthood in the technical professions, would report similar childhood 
experiences. </P>
<P>The Second World War provided its own share of strong impressions. Gone were 
the dirigibles and autogyros of the 1930s, only to be replaced in the public eye 
with high-performance warplanes. I clearly remember these as a source of 
enthusiastic attention, at least by young males in grammar school. How were they 
designed? What was their horsepower? What top speeds could they exhibit? And 
what design characteristics allowed these aircraft innovations to appear? </P>
<P>During the early half of the 1940s, "Materials Science" had not yet been 
anointed as a distinct discipline. Nevertheless, the strategic importance of 
certain critical materials during those war years was very much in the public 
consciousness. Simple examples are often the ones that impress children the 
most. The one that I remember as especially noticeable by my schoolmates and 
myself involved the scarce national supply of copper. This was the traditional 
material of that backbone of the economy (as we perceived it!), the penny. Yet, 
for the year 1943, the United States found it necessary to convert the minting 
operation to producing zinc-clad steel pennies. Such a visually obvious 
modification could not help but create a lasting metallurgical lesson! </P>
<P>My high school education occurred in Scarsdale, NY, which was, at the time, 
and still remains, one of the wealthiest communities in the nation. My family, 
then including three younger brothers, inhabited the lowest income quartile 
locally, owing to my father's modest income as a public school teacher of 
mathematics and industrial arts. This absence of disposable income at the time 
was a source of some personal discomfort. Scarsdale High School maintained high 
educational standards and was strongly committed to shipping a maximum 
percentage of its graduates off to college. Its mathematics and science teaching 
programs were certainly very good, but community standards and values seemingly 
placed primary emphasis on the business, medical, and legal professions. 
Consequently, the scientific encouragement available to interested and able 
students several miles to the south in technically oriented New York City high 
schools simply did not exist for me and my classmates. The relatively low 
percentage of the graduates who ultimately chose careers in technical fields 
reflected that distinction. </P>
<P>During junior high school and my early high school years, I must admit 
developing a strong antipathy toward the subject of English. Particularly 
annoying were the assigned readings of standard works in obsolete styles of 
writing, including poetry, drama, and novels. That antipathy inexorably 
translated into near-failing grades in those classes. However, a minor 
linguistic epiphany finally took place when I was a senior in high school. This 
occurred under the influence of an inspiring English instructor, perhaps because 
it was my first contact with a male instructor of that subject. The notion 
finally prevailed that language was a vital tool, even for scientists, and that 
communicating effectively and under a variety of circumstances involved skills 
that had to be learned and mastered. Flexible vocabulary, artfully chosen 
similes, unexpected humorous phrasings, and even creative sarcasm in the proper 
settings could be advantageous techniques. </P>
<P>High school graduation in 1951 was followed by four undergraduate years at 
the University of Rochester. This choice evidently was influenced by the fact 
that my mother had attended that university's Eastman School of Music, as a 
voice and piano student. Chemistry was my choice of major there, following and 
focusing the developing interests of the preceding few years. It must be 
admitted that my decision to continue and expand in the scientific realm 
disappointed my mother to some extent. She had hoped to see a musical career 
emerge in her first child. However, that disappointment became somewhat 
mitigated as my three younger brothers showed greater affinities in that 
direction. </P>
<P>An obvious milestone encounter at the University of Rochester occurred during 
my junior year there (1953-1954). Professor Frank P. Buff was the undergraduate 
physical chemistry instructor then, and as a result of his lectures, I became 
strongly attracted to that area of chemistry, particularly as a budding theorist 
in statistical mechanics. During the following year, Frank Buff served as my 
senior advisor and mentor. My senior project involved theoretical modeling and 
numerical calculation of the surface tension for aqueous electrolytes. That work 
later generated my first scientific publication. This problem involved an 
alternative approach to one initiated by Lars Onsager and his student, N. N. T. 
Samaras, whose work was published in 1934 in Volume 2 of the <I>Journal of 
Chemical Physics</I>. An obvious consequence of that senior project was that I 
would learn about, and be inspired by, the remarkable contributions that Lars 
Onsager had made to statistical mechanics, one of which would later earn him the 
1968 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. </P>
<P>Before joining the Chemistry Department faculty at Rochester, Frank Buff had 
earned his Ph.D. at Cal Tech under the direction of John G. Kirkwood. "Jack" 
Kirkwood had subsequently departed for Yale, becoming that Department's 
Chairman, and also becoming an Onsager colleague there. Perhaps it was natural 
that I would be influenced to attend graduate school at Yale, and to consider 
one of these two giants of statistical mechanics as a Ph.D. advisor. The balance 
finally tipped in Kirkwood's favor, in part owing to Onsager's tendency toward 
mystifying modes of verbal communication. Over the years, this tendency had 
impelled graduate students in the department to confer an informal title on his 
statistical mechanics graduate course, "Norwegian I". </P>
<P>My Ph.D. dissertation contained four distinct topics. Three were suggested by 
Jack Kirkwood: ion distributions in molten salts, the structure of electrical 
double layers at electrodes in concentrated salt solutions, and the partition 
functions for quantum fluids. The fourth was my own suggestion, to which 
Kirkwood seemed to take a liking. It amounted to a particle-size-coupling 
formalism for equilibrium distribution functions, some aspects of which were 
later developed by others under the popular title of "scaled particle theory". 
</P>
<P>After receiving my Ph.D. in theoretical chemistry from Yale in 1958, another 
year was spent at Yale to allow my wife Dorothea to complete her Master's Degree 
requirements in mathematics at the university. </P>
<P>During this additional year, I was classified as a Kirkwood postdoctoral 
collaborator, and under normal circumstances, it would have been a happy and 
productive time. However, Jack Kirkwood had developed a terminal case of cancer, 
which led to his untimely death at age 52 in August 1959. Watching the untimely 
demise of such an intellectually respected scholar is a sadly unforgettable 
experience. </P>
<P>A seemingly natural assumption held during the Yale years was that my 
professional future would be an academic career. But one result of the last few 
medically uncompromised discussions with Jack Kirkwood was that I also began to 
consider AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories as at least a temporary alternative. By 
1959, Bell Labs had earned a solid reputation as an excellent place to do basic 
research in the physical sciences. A logical strategy for a young person then 
was to spend a few years at such an institution, creating a significant 
publication record and establishing a respectable reputation, then transferring 
into academia at a somewhat advanced level. This would avoid the necessity of 
demeaning academic chores that reputedly were always dumped on junior faculty. 
As a result of such thinking, I joined the Research Area of Bell Labs in Murray 
Hill, NJ, in September 1959. The subsequent passage of time over many years 
witnessed a diminishing interest in the original plan to become an academic 
scientist. Whether or not it was a sensible judgment, my conclusion nevertheless 
was that whatever modest talents for science were present, they were not 
particularly applicable to effective teaching. </P>
<P>For approximately thirty years, the management at Murray Hill encouraged, and 
appropriately rewarded, its physical science researchers to pursue innovative 
basic and applied research. This was a nearly ideal setting for a young Ph.D. 
who was eager to set the intellectual world on fire, and there were dozens of us 
straining to do exactly that. Among other advantages that were present one would 
have to emphasize the low barriers between researchers from different academic 
disciplines. All of us were housed in the same interconnected building complex. 
Furthermore, it was an important aspect of the Bell Labs culture that one could 
freely walk down the hall to ask pertinent questions of a co-worker. Seminars 
were open to all and typically were attended by a broad spectrum of expertise. 
</P>
<P>As a result of the direct Kirkwood influence, and of interactions with many 
of his accomplished former students and co-authors, I had developed a strong 
research interest in liquid-state chemistry and physics. Pursuing that interest 
of course meant reading as many published papers on the subject as practicable 
and attending relevant conferences. Most notable among the latter was the 
biennial series of Gordon Conferences entitled "The Chemistry and Physics of 
Liquids". All of these scientific interactions during the early 1960s produced a 
strange ambivalence. On one hand, the field exhibited an admirable level of 
erudition in the systematic and careful tradition that was the well-known 
Kirkwood style (but shared by many others). On the other hand, the status, 
style, and emphasis of the field produced an uncomfortable impatience. The 
fashionable liquid-state models that garnered most attention (hard spheres, 
Lennard-Jones "atoms", etc.) were far too simple structurally to yield insights 
into the vast majority of real liquids that experimental science dealt with on a 
regular basis. Water was the pre-eminent and most obvious counterexample to the 
prevailing trend. This generated a personal decision to develop a systematic 
statistical mechanical formalism for water, both to stimulate deeper theoretical 
thinking about aqueous systems in solid and fluid phases, and also to induce the 
liquid-state community to tackle a wider spectrum of molecular substances and 
phenomena than it had been in the habit of examining. </P>
<P>The first phase of the water project got underway during 1967-1968, in 
collaboration with Arieh Ben-Naim, who was a postdoctoral associate. The 
principal objective was to construct an effective pair potential for water 
molecules that represented the formation of directional hydrogen bonds in at 
least a qualitatively correct fashion. This required considerable guessing, 
because rather little precise guidance was then available from direct 
quantum-mechanical computations for those interactions. </P>
<P>Molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo computer simulations had, by then, played 
a notable role in the physics and chemistry of simple liquids. Although computer 
power in the late 1960s was very weak by present-day standards, it nevertheless 
seemed to hold promise for penetrating the molecular mysteries of the water 
problem. A pre-eminent practitioner of the molecular dynamics variant of digital 
simulation during that period was Aneesur Rahman, who was working at the Argonne 
National Laboratory in Illinois. Both he and I happened to attend the Liquids 
Gordon Conference in August 1969, and as a result of conversations there, we 
agreed that the idea of a joint simulation project had substantial merit. Bell 
Labs was convinced to provide financial support to Argonne to cover most of the 
computer costs. The first of several joint papers that was co-authored with 
Rahman, covering a wide range of aqueous molecular attributes, appeared in 1971. 
Needless to say, computer simulations of aqueous systems presently continue to 
be a popular and vigorous research area, one outcome of which has been the 
appearance of vastly improved effective pair potentials, compared to the initial 
crude estimates of over 30 years ago. </P>
<P>The opportunities for other productive collaborations in the early years at 
Murray Hill were numerous and would require a much more extensive format than 
this to document in detail. However, it is important to mention one more notable 
example: Dr. Thomas A. Weber. Tom first joined Bell Labs at Murray Hill in a 
development group, but later successfully sought an internal transfer to my 
research area. He possessed formidable computer programming skills, 
complementing my almost-total computer illiteracy. We joined forces, and over a 
period of nearly 20 years, produced 42 publications. </P>
<P>Following the 1984 U.S. Justice Department's divestiture order for the Bell 
Telephone System, the previously encouraging environment for basic research 
began to change. These changes were almost imperceptible at first, but became 
increasingly intrusive. Lucent Technologies acquired control of Bell Labs at 
Murray Hill in 1996, and established its corporate headquarters there. It became 
increasingly clear to many of my colleagues in research there that their 
professional careers required moving to other institutions. By virtue of staying 
longer at Murray Hill than many others did, I experienced an involuntarily 
transfer to a Lucent spinoff, Agere Systems, which had an even more impatient 
attitude toward basic research. My employment there terminated in June 2001. 
</P>
<P>Toward the end of 1996, I was invited to be a frequent visitor at Princeton 
University, for purposes of scientific collaboration with Professor Pablo G. 
Debenedetti and his group of students. This provided a welcome contrast to the 
other situation 30 miles to the northeast and generated several engaging 
research projects. The Princeton connection has subsequently expanded to include 
the Chemistry Department, thanks to Professor Salvatore Torquato, with whom 
other collaborative research projects have also been productively pursued. The 
Princeton connection continues at the time of this writing. </P>
<P>Autobiographies are intrinsically unfinished stories. Those of us who inhabit 
the world of scientific research continue to marvel at the unanticipated 
directions in which its advances take us. It remains to be seen what additional 
chapters the present story will eventually require. Frank H.
